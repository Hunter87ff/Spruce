## Performance & Safety

### Rate Limiting

All bulk operations include built-in rate limiting:

- **Small batches** (‚â§10 members) - Immediate processing
- **Medium batches** (11-50 members) - 1-second delays
- **Large batches** (51+ members) - 2-second delays with progress updates

### Safety Features

=== "Privilege Protection"
    - Cannot assign roles higher than bot's role
    - Prevents admin role assignment to multiple users
    - Checks role hierarchy before operations

=== "Confirmation Dialogs"
    - Destructive actions require confirmation
    - Shows affected member/role counts
    - Provides cancel options

=== "Undo Functionality"
    - Reverse buttons for role assignments
    - 10-minute timeout for undo actions
    - Clear action descriptions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

=== "Role Hierarchy Errors"
    **Error:** "Role is higher than mine"
    
    **Solution:** Move bot's role above target roles in Server Settings ‚Üí Roles

=== "Missing Permissions"
    **Error:** "I don't have permission to manage this role"
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Grant bot "Manage Roles" permission
    - Check if role is managed by another bot
    - Verify role isn't @everyone

=== "Large Server Performance"
    **Issue:** Commands timing out on large servers
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Use smaller batches
    - Wait between operations
    - Monitor for rate limits

### Best Practices

#### Role Organization

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Owner] --> B[Admins]
    B --> C[Moderators]
    C --> D[Spruce Bot]
    D --> E[VIP Members]
    E --> F[Regular Members]
    F --> G[New Members]
    G --> H[Bots]
```

#### Workflow Recommendations

1. **Plan role structure** before implementation
2. **Test with small groups** before mass operations
3. **Use descriptive role names** for clarity
4. **Document role purposes** for staff
5. **Regular role audits** to remove unused roles
