## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

=== "Permission Errors"

    **Solutions:**
    - Ensure bot role is above target roles
    - Grant bot the required permissions
    - Check channel-specific permissions

=== "Cannot Delete Messages"
    **Error:** "Cannot delete messages older than 14 days"
    
    **Solution:** Discord API limitation - use smaller batches or manual deletion

=== "Rate Limiting"
    **Error:** Commands becoming slow or timing out
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Wait between bulk operations
    - Use smaller batch sizes
    - Avoid rapid consecutive commands

### Error Messages

| Error | Meaning | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| "Role is higher than mine" | Target role is above bot's role | Move bot role higher in hierarchy |
| "Missing permissions" | Bot lacks required permissions | Grant necessary permissions |
| "Cannot kick/ban user" | Target has higher permissions | Only kick/ban users with lower roles |
| "Message too old" | Message older than 14 days | Cannot bulk delete old messages |

## Best Practices

### Security Guidelines

- ‚úÖ **Always provide reasons** for moderation actions

### Workflow Recommendations

1. **Channel Management**
   - Use `&lock` during important announcements
   - `&hide` sensitive channels from general members
   - Unlock channels after discussions

2. **Message Cleanup**
   - Regular cleanup with `&clear` for active channels
   - Target specific users for spam cleanup
