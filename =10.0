    a spinner and timer while the command is running. The exit status of the
    command is propagated.

  --format-table

    Read tabular data from standard input (each line is a row and each

    print the resulting table to standard output. See also the --delimiter
    option.

    Change the delimiter used by --format-table to VALUE (a string). By default
    all whitespace is treated as a delimiter.

    readable string and print that string to standard output.

  -s, --format-size=BYTES

    Convert a byte count (given as the integer BYTES) into a human readable
    string and print that string to standard output.

  -b, --binary

    Change the output of -s, --format-size to use binary multiples of bytes
    (base-2) instead of the default decimal multiples of bytes (base-10).

  -t, --format-timespan=SECONDS

    Convert a number of seconds (given as the floating point number SECONDS)
    into a human readable timespan and print that string to standard output.

  --parse-length=VALUE

    Parse a human readable length (given as the string VALUE) and print the
